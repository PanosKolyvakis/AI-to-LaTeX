\section{Introduction}
The \texttt{cat} command is a commonly used command in the Bash shell for concatenating files and displaying their contents. In this blog post, we will explore the various use cases of the \texttt{cat} command and delve into its functionality within pipelines. We will reference the following websites throughout the blog post:

\section{The \texttt{cat} Command}

The \texttt{cat} command (short for "concatenate") is primarily used for viewing and combining text files. It reads one or more files as input and outputs their content in the terminal or piped to another command.

By default, \texttt{cat} simply displays the content of a file. However, it becomes more powerful when combined with other commands using pipelines.

\section{Pipelines in Bash}

Pipelines in Bash allow the output of one command to serve as the input to the next command. This way, multiple commands can be chained together, creating a data flow from one command to another.

To create a pipeline in Bash, we use the pipe symbol (\texttt{|}) to connect the output of one command to the input of the next command. For example:

\[
\texttt{command1 | command2}
\]

Here, the output of \texttt{command1} is passed as input to \texttt{command2}. This enables powerful combinations and transforms simple commands like \texttt{cat} into more complex data processing pipelines.
